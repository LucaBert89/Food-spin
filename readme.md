# FOOD SPIN (DESKTOP ONLY)

A landing page made to let you choose your preferred dish with a detailed recipe linked to the choosen one. Choose the dish from the wheel using the arrow buttons.

I realized this project to learn how to do better animations with css and javascript.

I split JS files using **export and import ES6** functionality. With the DATA.js file I tried to **simulate a response from a server** where I get images and recipes returning them in the frontend.

# technologies used
* **Javascript**
* **Scss**
* Module bundler: **webpack**

# Working methodology

* I followed a **Figma's** prototype and this video for animation behaviour https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XJqJJQ35oc;
* I tracked time spent on the activities with **Toggl tracker**;
* I organized the tasks using **Trello**;
